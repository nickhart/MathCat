## In Progress 🚧

Ready to start Phase 2: Core Components

## Next Up 📅

**Priority**: Build multiplication method variants (partial products and area model) as proof of concept

1. Create basic math components (EquationEditor, DigitGrid, CarryIndicator)
2. Implement MultiplicationPartialProducts component
3. Implement MultiplicationAreaModel component
4. Create Storybook stories for each component
5. Add unit tests

## Known Issues 🐛

None currently
